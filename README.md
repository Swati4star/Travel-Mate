A must-have app for those interested in travel. The app provides users with various features from **choosing the correct destination** to **making all the bookings** and to **easily organizing the trip**. The platform basically uses a [mash-up technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)). The app provides solutions for every possible problem a traveller might face during the course of his or her entire journey.

## How Travel Mate Works

While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered to make the trip a memorable one. Our platform helps the traveller with anything and everything that he or she might need, from the moment he or she plans the journey till the time he or she is back home happy and content.
The platform includes a wide variety of options - from selection of Mode of Transport, to finding out about the destination city, to provision of best music, novels, depending on the mood of the traveller. Travel Mate basically works in 3 phases.

## Select Destination
A comprehensive list of all the information one would need to know about a city, be it current weather of the city or a list of best hangout places there. Along with the information, the current trend of the city on twitter can also be seen. (It is extracted from Twitter using Twitter and Yahoo! APIs).
Based on this information and the recommendation from the app, user can opt for the preferred destination location.

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download).

__I've found a bug!__ 
Let us know [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar problem). 
If it's a documentation, web site, or examples problem, take that up with folks [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues). 
There are also separate locations for [Android Mode](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues), or the [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues) and [Sound](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues) libraries. 
The [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their issue tracker [here](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/issues).

__That [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs) fella is a damn liar.__ 
The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references 
amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to 
changes made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.
Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within Github.
Help speed this process along by helping us!

__Please help.__
The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions). 
Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save us a lot of time.

__And finally...__
Someday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today.

So in the meantime, I ask for your patience, 
[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List), 
and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).
